This repository includes the fusion 360 files for this version of the OpenERV.  It is not the most recent version, see openerv.org for the most recent version.
There are no assembly instructions or printing instructions for this version, it was just a prototype that I made only one of, so there is no sense making such documentation.  
The cad files are slighly useful for anyone engaging in further development, or using the prototype as a working, serviceable unit.
